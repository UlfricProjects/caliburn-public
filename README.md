Caliburn Public API

Demos: https://github.com/UlfricProjects/caliburn-public/tree/master/src/demo/java/

Requires an API key. Get your key by logging into our Minecraft server, ```caliburn.us``` or ```caliburn.io```, and using ```/api```. Rate limited to 100 requests per minute. You're expected to implement caching yourself.

Uses OkHttp by Square for http communication.
